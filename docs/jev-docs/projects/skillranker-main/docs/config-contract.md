# Configuration and authority contract (P0)

`src/config.rs` freezes the v1 configuration key registry, per-layer trust rules,
precedence, provenance and effective-policy receipts. `src/privacy/mod.rs` defines
invocation effect flags, network consent, the credential type, provider admission
and root containment. Both are pure: they read no files or environment, perform no
network or subprocess work and create no state. They do not implement TOML decoding,
clap parsing, `doctor --config`, origin canonicalization or effect enforcement.

## Layers and precedence

Ordinary values resolve `built-in → trusted user → project → environment → CLI`.
Each key declares one rule per layer: `forbidden`, `allowed`, or `restrict-only`
(may keep or narrow the value resolved from lower layers, never widen it). Lists
of exclusions and roster roots merge as unions, so a later layer can add entries
but cannot remove a trusted user's. A known key in a forbidden layer is an error,
not an ignored value. Reserved keys are recognized so an attempt is reported
precisely, but are settable in no layer in v1.

The command boundary supplies bounded entries: dotted paths for file and CLI
layers, and an environment snapshot. It must reject duplicate TOML keys during
decoding and finish this validation before discovery, networking or mutation.
Any issue invalidates the whole policy; up to 32 issues are listed, with the rest
counted. Diagnostics name layers and known registry keys, never values. Unknown
key names are discarded from diagnostic state and rendered as `<unknown key>`;
their text cannot appear in Display, Debug, or the public issue list.

| Key | Environment | CLI | User | Project | Env | CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `network.enabled` | — | — | allowed | forbidden | — | — |
| `network.proxy` | — | — | reserved | reserved | — | — |
| `typesafe.api_key` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | — | forbidden | forbidden | allowed | — |
| `typesafe.endpoint` | `TYPESAFE_ENDPOINT` | — | forbidden | forbidden | allowed | — |
| `provider.model` | `SR_MODEL` | — | allowed | forbidden | allowed | — |
| `hook.mode` | — | `--shadow` | allowed | forbidden | — | restrict-only |
| `context.profile` | — | `--context-profile` | allowed | restrict-only | — | allowed |
| `context.no_tools` | — | `--no-tools` | allowed | restrict-only | — | restrict-only |
| `context.messages` (1–12) | `SR_MESSAGES` | `--messages` | allowed | restrict-only | allowed | allowed |
| `context.budget_chars` (1–12,000) | `SR_BUDGET_CHARS` | `--budget-chars` | allowed | restrict-only | allowed | allowed |
| `context.transcript_roots` | — | — | allowed (absolute) | forbidden | — | — |
| `ranking.top`, `ranking.shortlist` (1–32) | `SR_TOP`, `SR_SHORTLIST` | `--top`, `--shortlist` | allowed | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| `ranking.gate`, `ranking.fits` ([0,1]) | `SR_GATE`, `SR_FITS` | `--gate`, `--fits` | allowed | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| `ranking.w_fit` / `w_prior` / `w_phase` | — | — | allowed | allowed | — | — |
| `ranking.timeout_ms` (201–60,000) | `SR_TIMEOUT_MS` | `--timeout-ms` | allowed | forbidden | allowed | allowed |
| `ranking.exclude_skills` (≤128) | — | — | allowed | allowed | — | — |
| `roster.roots` (≤32) | — | — | allowed | allowed (contained) | — | — |
| `privacy.redaction`, `privacy.raw_retention` | — | — | reserved | reserved | — | — |

Weights use the plan bounds `[0,4]`, `[0,0.5]` and `[0,1]`. Integer file values
are accepted for float keys; NaN and infinity are rejected everywhere. After
merging, `ranking.top` must not exceed `ranking.shortlist`. Disclosure-volume keys
are ordered for restriction: `minimal < standard`, `no_tools = true` is narrower,
and fewer messages or characters are narrower. `shadow < advisory` for hook mode.

The environment layer is strict inside `SR_`: an unrecognized `SR_*` variable or a
non-UTF-8 `SR_` name is an error, so a misspelled privacy setting is never ignored.
Other variables, including other `TYPESAFE_*` names, are outside the schema.
Environment values are parsed as `true`/`false`, unsigned decimal digits, or Rust
floating-point text. An empty `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is absent; a key with whitespace,
controls or more than 4 KiB is a configuration error.

Project roots must be relative and lexically contained in the workspace. Only
trusted user configuration may add an absolute root, which may not contain `..`.
Symlink containment is enforced when a reader opens the path. Transcript roots are
trusted-user-only and absolute. Each names a Claude-style projects directory that
bare `sr rank` session discovery searches in addition to `$HOME/.claude/projects`
(see [source selection](source-selection.md)).

## Effects, consent and admission

`EffectPolicy::from_flags` reports every conflict: `--offline` or `--dry-run` with
`--allow-network`, and `--save-case` with `--dry-run` or `--no-persist`. Dry run and
`--no-persist` disable the response cache, ledger and persistent runtime state
(keys, locks, leases, cooldowns and allowance accounting); `--no-cache` and
`--no-ledger` disable only their store. Offline blocks network access but still
permits cache reads and local explicit resolution. Ordinary configuration reads
remain allowed in every mode.

Network consent comes only from `--allow-network` or trusted `network.enabled`.
Offline and dry run block it even when trusted consent exists. A credential's
presence is never consent. `admit_provider_attempt` checks consent before the
credential, so a blocked or unauthorized run never reports a key problem. The
credential is a separate non-serializable value with redacted `Debug`; receipts
record only its presence.

Each failure maps onto the output schema's `ErrorKind` through `kind()`:
configuration issues are `invalid-configuration` and flag conflicts are
`invalid-usage` (both exit 2). A refused admission maps as follows: missing consent
or dry run gives `network-denied` (exit 8), and offline gives `cache-miss`
(exit 11). An offline refusal only arises when no complete valid cached result
exists. A missing key gives `authentication` (exit 4).

## Receipts and revalidation

`ResolvedConfig::receipt` captures effective values, derived consent, credential
presence, effect flags, per-key source layers and a caller-supplied read generation.
`ResolvedConfig::revalidate` re-reads only the trusted user and project layers,
reusing this invocation's environment and CLI layers, and compares effective values
for one boundary's dependency projection:

| Boundary | Fields compared |
| --- | --- |
| Provider admission (every HTTP attempt) | consent, credential presence, endpoint, model, profile, no-tools, messages, budget, transcript roots, shortlist, exclusions, roster roots |
| CLI advisory publication | top, shortlist, gate, fits, weights, exclusions, roster roots |
| CLI explicit publication | roster roots |
| Hook advisory publication | CLI advisory fields plus hook mode |
| Hook explicit publication | roster roots, hook mode |

The invocation deadline is fixed at entry and appears in no projection. Network
consent does not gate local publication. Comments, file bytes and hidden edits
do not supersede advice: an edit overridden by a fixed CLI or environment value
leaves the effective value unchanged and is not reported as a revocation. Invalid
current configuration fails closed. A superseded result is withheld; the change
never authorizes a replacement request. Later phases add snooze, trial and learned
policy fields.

## Managed mutations

`ManagedPolicyMutation` validates calibration apply and rollback changes. Its
target is always trusted user configuration, and only `ranking.gate`,
`ranking.fits` and the three weights are writable. Authority, routing, disclosure,
hook, root and exclusion keys are rejected. The writer must preview first, compare
the recorded base digest with the file before an atomic replace, keep an
owner-only backup, and preserve every unrelated setting.

## Verification scope

`tests/config_contract.rs` checks registry consistency and bounds, and tests each
security-sensitive key at all four layers against a matrix written independently
of the registry. It also covers restrict-only widening with successful narrowing
counterparts, root containment, and that a key alone grants no consent while
trusted consent and `--allow-network` do. Further tests show that authority-shaped
fields in normalized input are rejected, that duplicate, unknown, NaN, infinite,
out-of-range and non-UTF-8 inputs are all reported together, and cover precedence,
all 128 flag combinations, boundary projections, fixed-layer edits, managed
mutations and private `Debug` output. These are library-level tests; the CLI
filesystem/effect matrix belongs to sr-roadmap-l1i.3.18 and sr-roadmap-l1i.5.1.
