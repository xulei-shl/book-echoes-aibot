# Exact source selection

`context::source` binds one local input before a reader runs. It neither reads
stdin speculatively nor selects a source by inspecting JSON shape. The library
boundary supplies selection to the normalized, native and cass readers; it does
not enable the later `rank` or hook CLI commands by itself.

## Explicit inputs

`SourceOptions::resolve` accepts a separately resolved `WorkspaceId`, source
effect policy, controlling-terminal availability and a lazy discovery callback.
The caller supplies its observation of offered stdin in `stdin_supplied`.
Offered stdin without an explicit hook/normalized-stdin mode is a usage error
before discovery, including when a file source was also supplied. The selector
never probes a pipe or guesses its format. A noninteractive invocation with no
offered stdin can still discover a unique session.
The callback is called only when no explicit source was selected. Source flags
are mutually exclusive; `latest` cannot accompany an explicit source.

| Options | Bound reader target |
|---|---|
| `claude_hook` | Claude hook stdin, whose decoded event supplies exact identity |
| `context = "-"` | Normalized stdin, even if empty or attached to a terminal |
| `context = FILE` | That normalized file |
| `transcript = FILE`, `harness = claude_code` | That Claude native transcript |
| `cass_session = PATH` | That cass archive session |
| No source | Bounded discovery for the exact resolved workspace |

An absent native harness is a usage error. An unsupported harness is
`unsupported-input` (exit 7); the selector does not infer a format from a path.
Native/cass bare `-` is rejected; stdin is available only through the documented
hook or normalized mode. Paths retain native bytes and have private Debug output.
They must be nonempty, NUL-free and at most 4 KiB. Selection does not grant file
access: regular-file checks, authorized roots, symlink containment, snapshots and
byte/depth limits belong to the readers.

`SourceSelection::read` invokes the supplied reader once and returns its result
unchanged. It has no fallback or retry path. A missing, malformed or replaced
chosen source never triggers discovery or opens another conversation. The reader
must compare a discovered selection's `expected_identity` with the opened
source; a selection is not proof that the filesystem stayed unchanged.

## Discovery and identity

Discovery receives `SourcePolicy` before doing work. Its adapter must enforce
that policy at its effect boundary, bound enumeration/parsing before allocation,
and return a complete inventory or an explicit failure. The selector also bounds
the inventory to 10,000 entries and 32 MiB of path bytes before copying candidates.
Incomplete pagination or an entry with unresolved workspace identity prevents a
uniqueness claim. No missing attribution is invented.

Only exact workspace-ID equality admits an entry. Prefix matches, ancestors and
a linked worktree's shared Git directory confer no relationship. The trusted
resolver must identify each worktree separately; this module does not implement
that filesystem resolver. Session, agent, branch, epoch and source provenance are
preserved. Duplicate identities fail even when their paths or timestamps differ.
Native and cass provenance must match the selected reader. Normalized imports
are explicit inputs and never masquerade as discovered native sessions.

### Native Claude discovery

With no source flag, `sr rank` discovers native Claude Code sessions through
`context::discovery`. It looks in `$HOME/.claude/projects` and in each
trusted-user `context.transcript_roots` entry, which names a directory with the
same layout. Within those roots it lists only this workspace's directories.
Claude's directory encoding is an unverified harness convention that changed
between versions: older versions replaced `/` with `-`, newer ones replace every
character that is not ASCII alphanumeric. Discovery therefore tries each
spelling, and a name alone admits nothing:

- Only top-level regular `*.jsonl` files are opened, without following
  symlinks. Each is read for at most 64 KiB from its start and, for recency,
  at most 64 KiB from its end.
- A transcript is a candidate only when its first recorded `cwd` is exactly
  the workspace and a record carries its file name as `sessionId`. All session
  IDs present in the bounded head must agree. Records use the bounded,
  duplicate-key-rejecting JSON decoder. That session ID is the candidate's
  identity; the head check does not verify records beyond the head.
- Recency is the last complete record's recorded `timestamp`
  (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.fraction]Z`, parsed strictly), not the file's
  modification time. With no valid recorded time, recency is unknown, and
  `--latest` treats the choice as ambiguous.
- A file read to its end that claims its own session ID but never records a
  `cwd` holds no conversation turn. Claude leaves such stubs, containing only
  session metadata. It is not a candidate and does not make the inventory
  incomplete. Read only in part, the same evidence stays unresolved.
- At most 1,000 transcripts are examined. Reaching that bound, or an unreadable
  directory or transcript, leaves the inventory incomplete. Malformed records,
  conflicting identity, and heads with no complete attribution also leave it
  incomplete. Neither bare rank nor `--latest` chooses around an unresolved
  file. A verified first `cwd` naming another workspace excludes that file.
- The same file reached through two names or roots counts once.

An explicit `--transcript` path gets the same attribution when its records name
this workspace. Otherwise its cache and single-flight namespace stays private
to that run. Before reading a discovered session, `sr rank` confirms it still
carries the chosen identity. A unique selection adds a `discovered-session`
warning, and `--latest` adds `latest-session`. Each carries the eligible count
and does not claim the session is live. Discovery reads local files only; it
never runs cass or another child process.

| Complete eligible inventory | Result |
|---|---|
| Empty | `missing-session`, exit 3 |
| One entry | Select it with `UniqueInWorkspace` |
| Several, no controlling terminal | `ambiguous-session`, exit 3 |
| Several, controlling terminal | `NeedsChoice`; UI must obtain an explicit index |
| Explicit latest request | Select a uniquely newest timestamp with `LatestRequested` |

Latest selection requires known timestamps and a unique maximum. Ties or unknown
recency fail as ambiguous, including in a TTY. Its reason and eligible candidate
count remain available for disclosure; it never claims that recency proves a
session is live. Interactive choices retain an immutable candidate inventory;
out-of-range choices fail. UI rendering and terminal reads are separate effects.

Remote candidates in the selected workspace are rejected. Cass `source_id`,
when present in discovered provenance, remains attached to the chosen session.
An explicit cass path has no invented source ID: its reader must obtain and
validate provenance from the actual export.

## Source policy and diagnostics

Offline, dry-run and local-only modes refuse explicit cass before discovery or
reader invocation: `unsupported-source-mode`, exit 7, with a direct/normalized
input hint. A discovery adapter must avoid invoking cass under those policies;
the selector also refuses an accidentally supplied eligible cass entry instead
of silently picking a native alternative. `allow_network` conflicts with these
local modes. Selection never reads credentials or authorizes Jev transmission.

Source errors contain fixed diagnostic text and map to the existing output
`ErrorKind` contract. Private paths, unknown harness names and session IDs are
not included in error text or Debug output.

## Verification boundary

`tests/source_selection.rs` exercises all explicit routes, conflicting flags,
stdin-shape confusion, mode restrictions, concurrent sessions, subagent branches,
latest disclosure, incomplete/duplicate/remote inventories and private diagnostics.
The filesystem tests create real files and linked Git worktrees, read the bound
file, and retain failed-source/successful-neighbor counterparts. Their synthetic
contents are selection evidence, not native-parser or live-harness evidence.

The P3 `context` end-to-end suite remains planned in the phase matrix. Concrete
Rust test references replace the earlier prospective `context_contract.rs` name;
executed checks are recorded on bead `sr-roadmap-l1i.4.1`. Pure normalized byte
decoding is now provided by `skillranker::context::parse_normalized_context`:
it enforces the 1 MiB byte limit and JSON depth 64, rejects duplicate keys, and
validates schema and definitions with fixed `ContextError` diagnostics. See the
[identity contract](identity-contract.md) for its local-input guarantees. This
does not implement normalized filesystem/stdin reading, context windowing or
provider serialization, and does not turn normalized identity into native
authority. Native snapshot parsing, cass capability/subprocess integration and
CLI delivery remain their respective downstream tasks. No live Jev request is
needed to test this local boundary.
