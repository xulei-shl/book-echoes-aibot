# Qualified cache storage foundation

`skillranker::storage` is a Linux library boundary for opening an explicitly
selected disposable cache, fencing generation changes, and holding the
persistent exact response cache that `sr rank` uses: an owner-only fingerprint
key and generation-stamped validated responses. It does not initialize an
observation ledger or create an allowance store, and there is no storage CLI.

## Entry points and effects

`open_cache(&ProcessInvocation, &Cx, CacheAccess, CacheLocation)` returns
`CacheOpen::{Disabled, Missing, Ready}` or a sanitized `StoreError`.

| Access | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Disabled` | Returns before resolving environment/platform paths, inspecting the engine, submitting blocking work, or touching files. Use for no-cache, no-persist and dry-run callers. |
| `ExistingOnly` | Does not create missing directories or the main file. Missing state is a typed miss; an empty existing file is uninitialized. SQLite can create/update WAL shared-memory bookkeeping for an existing store. |
| `Initialize` | Explicitly permits creating the private cache directory/main file and current cache schema. Repeated initialization preserves the incarnation and generation. |

`CacheLocation::Platform` uses `directories::BaseDirs::cache_dir()/sr`
(`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/sr`, falling back to `~/.cache/sr` on Linux).
`Directory(PathBuf)` is a trusted-host override, never a path taken from a
transcript, skill, project-controlled disclosure setting, or provider answer.
Relative paths, parent traversal and paths over 4,096 bytes/128 components are
refused. Debug representations omit paths and store incarnation identifiers.

`CacheStore::advance_generation` consumes the connection, moves it through the
invocation's owned blocking pool and returns it on success. It checks the exact
schema, store incarnation and expected generation inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
before changing the singleton metadata row. A stale writer cannot restore an
old generation. Exhaustion fails without wrapping. There is no public raw SQL
or unfenced mutation escape hatch. Future response records must bind to the
same stamp; this method alone does not implement cache clear or eviction.

## Engine and schema qualification

The dependency is pinned to `rusqlite =0.40.2`, with defaults disabled and
`bundled`, `hooks`, and `limits` enabled. The locked bundle is
`libsqlite3-sys 0.38.2`, SQLite **3.53.2**, source ID:

```text
2026-06-03 19:12:13 d6e03d8c777cfa2d35e3b60d8ec3e0187f3e9f99d8e2ee9cac695fd6fcdf1a24
```

Before any disk store is opened or created, an in-memory connection reads the
actual linked version and source ID. Both must match this qualified identity
and the version must satisfy the project's 3.51.3 minimum. A different bundle
fails closed until its source and tests are reviewed; a Cargo version string
alone is not engine evidence. `linked_engine()` exposes only this public engine
identity for future doctor integration. See [SQLite's WAL documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).

Schema version 3 uses application ID `SRCH` and exactly four strict tables:
metadata (an opaque 16-byte random incarnation, nonnegative generation and a
fixed schema identity), the fingerprint key (32 bytes from the operating
system CSPRNG, drawn once at initialization), validated responses, and single-flight
leases. Every
table's stored DDL and the singleton cardinalities are checked, so a matching
`user_version` alone cannot authorize mutation. A newer schema is inspected with
a read-only SQLite connection and rejected. This is not a promise of zero WAL
shared-memory bookkeeping. Corrupt, foreign, or incompatible stores, including
version 1 foundation stores and version 2 response caches, are refused without replacement, downgrade,
permission repair, or automatic migration. The rank caller then continues
uncached. No migration, backup or repair command is implemented here.

`CacheStore::response` reads one entry of the current generation by exact
namespace hash, stage and request fingerprint. `CacheStore::record_response`
writes one inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. Both check the store incarnation and
generation first, so a handle from before a generation change can neither read
nor record. A response row keeps the validated wire bytes (at most the 2 MiB
decoded-response cap), receipt time, a TTL of 1–600 seconds, the requested
model alias, an optional revision and the original usage. Recording first
prunes rows of other generations, rows past their TTL and rows dated in the
future; none of them could ever be served. Freshness, model matching and stage
pairing are the caller's decisions (see [response cache](response-cache.md)).
The key never leaves the store except as keyed-hash input, and `Debug` output
omits it.

## Single-store response publication

Production lease acquisition, settlement reads, completion, and response writes
use the same qualified `cache.sqlite3`. They do not create `leases.sqlite3` or
use the helper coordinator's alternate response schema. Lease rows contain
only bounded ownership metadata and share the cache's page and sidecar quota.

`record_response_fenced` checks the supplied cache path, store incarnation and
generation, current lease owner and fencing generation, completion status, and
expiry inside the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` that inserts the response. Expiry is
checked again before commit. A successor cannot acquire between validation and
publication. No database transaction spans provider work. Completion is a later
metadata transaction; neither this design nor stdout delivery claims exactly-once
publication. Optional recording or completion failures retain a valid answer with
warnings; confirmed supersession withholds it.

Older stores are preserved and refused, with no hook-time migration. Old cache
and lease files are not removed. Upgrading does not coordinate concurrent old
and new executable versions through those incompatible stores.

## Filesystem boundary

Directory traversal uses descriptor-relative, no-follow opens. Existing ancestors
must be owned by the current effective user or root and must not be writable by
other users; root-owned sticky directories such as `/tmp` are allowed. The final
directory must belong to the effective user with mode `0700`. Main, WAL, SHM and
rollback-journal files must be regular, singly linked, owned by that user and
mode `0600`. Unsafe symlinks, hardlinks, FIFOs and unexpected types are refused.
New directories/files are created with private modes; unsafe existing modes are
not silently changed. Restrictive umasks may cause a safe refusal.

Linux ext4, Btrfs, XFS and tmpfs filesystem identifiers are admitted; network,
FUSE and unknown filesystems are refused. The type is checked for a new
directory's parent before creation and for the final store. This whitelist is a
conservative admission policy, not proof of every underlying storage device's
durability. Other operating systems are currently unqualified and do not export
the module. tmpfs caches disappear on reboot.

Held directory/main descriptors and identity rechecks detect ordinary replacement.
SQLite additionally uses `SQLITE_OPEN_NOFOLLOW`. SQLite still opens a pathname:
this boundary does not isolate an attacker with the same effective UID, root, or
the ability to replace trusted mounts. Such actors can already modify the user's
private data. A private directory is required throughout the connection lifetime.

## Bounds, durability and caller obligations

Every connection verifies WAL and foreign keys. Caches use `synchronous=NORMAL`;
this is disposable state and does not establish the `FULL` durability required
for protected request accounting. There is no transaction spanning provider I/O.
SQLite busy waits are refreshed at transaction/commit admission and bounded by
25 ms and the invocation's remaining work window. A progress handler checks
cancellation/deadline during SQL execution. Temporary tables stay in memory;
SQL/value sizes and attached databases/worker threads are restricted.

The main file and known sidecars share a 64 MiB logical cap. Admission keeps
4 MiB for maintenance plus 1 MiB of mutation margin, and requires 5 MiB free on
the filesystem. A connection page-count ceiling, a 64-page automatic checkpoint
interval and a 1 MiB journal-size target complement pre/post file checks. The
writable data is the metadata and key singletons and bounded response rows; at
the page ceiling recording stops with a typed error and ranking continues
uncached. The journal target is not a hard WAL limit when readers pin frames;
subsequent operations stop at the recording ceiling. Backup files and temporary
copies need their own conservative growth admission before being added. External writers and
unrelated disk consumption cannot be globally bounded by these checks.

Close-time checkpointing is disabled to avoid adding an unbudgeted maintenance
checkpoint on drop. WAL files can remain after closing; they are part of the
store and must never be copied or removed independently as a supposed backup.
Cooperative operations run in the accepted owned blocking runtime. Neither a
SQLite progress callback nor a timer interrupts an uninterruptible kernel I/O
wait. Late completion is drained and suppressed by the runtime boundary.

An error after commit or cancellation during finalization can leave a committed
generation even when no successful result was published. Callers must reopen
and inspect state before retrying a required mutation; an error is not proof of
rollback. Optional cache failure degrades to a visible miss in the future caller.
Never infer ledger/accounting readiness from cache readiness.

## Verification

`tests/storage_contract.rs` exercises the real production opener against private
temporary trees and bundled SQLite: actual engine identity, disabled/missing
effects, repeated initialization, private WAL files, path/type/link/mode refusals,
corrupt/foreign/newer stores, schema drift, real lock contention with successful
retry, generation/incarnation fencing, overflow, cancellation, expiry, quota,
directory replacement and abrupt process death across committed/uncommitted
generations. Response-cache cases cover a random, stable, never-printed key; exact
response identity and generation fencing for reads and writes; pruning of
expired, future and earlier-generation rows; refusal of unbounded entries; and
refusal of a version 1 store without repair. Unit tests separately cover engine qualification and the
filesystem/free-space admission predicates. Synthetic policy inputs are not
evidence of a real mounted network filesystem or an actual disk-full crash.

Run remotely with `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- cargo test --locked
--test storage_contract -- --nocapture`, plus the repository's full test, check
and Clippy gates. Test logs contain case/stage/schema, elapsed time, disposition
and public engine identifiers; no private paths or database contents. Test trees
are retained under Linux `/tmp` (RCH's `TMPDIR` can have shared ancestors) to comply with
the repository's deletion policy. Record the exact source/lockfile and remote
worker alongside logs; an unexecuted gate is not a pass.

## Private export publication

`storage::export::export_private_atomic` validates every destination-directory
component with no-follow descriptor opens. Ancestors must be owned by the caller
or root and must not be group/world writable, except for root-owned sticky
directories such as `/tmp`. The final directory must be caller-owned or
root-owned sticky. Symlinked ancestors are refused, including a symlink leading
to an otherwise safe final directory. Relative paths and `..` retain their normal
filesystem meaning subject to the same checks. Paths are bounded to 4,096 bytes
and 128 components.

The exporter creates a short exclusive temporary name in the held parent,
applies mode `0600` to its descriptor, writes and flushes the file, then publishes
without replacing any existing target. Publication and temporary-file cleanup
use that same parent descriptor. The directory is flushed and its pathname is
revalidated before success. A valid long target name does not lengthen the
temporary name. No post-publication chmod follows a target pathname.

Errors after publication can leave a complete destination file in place.
`ExportError::Durability` specifically means the parent flush failed; it does
not mean publication rolled back. Inspect the destination before retrying, and
never remove a raced-in or already published file as compensation. As with the
cache opener, this does not protect against hostile same-user mutation or
privileged mount replacement, and validation cannot freeze paths after return.

`tests/export_contract.rs`, the export unit tests, and the existing roster
export/race tests exercise this Linux boundary. The unit flush failure uses a
real pipe descriptor, and the replacement test operates on real directories;
neither establishes an actual power-loss experiment. macOS storage/export
qualification remains separate and is not established by these Linux results.
